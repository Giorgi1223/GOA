<h1> Hello everyone this site is specially designed for Goal Oriented Academy Leaders,</h1>

<p> This is the main leader and teacher of our academy, his name is Nika Keshelava,

<P> And now we introduce you to some of our mentors
 who try their best to teach us all about programming and grow us into future mentors. </P>


<p> My mentor is Luka Tshvaradze, unlike other mentors, with whom I have only had contact two or three times,</p>
<p> I know more about him than other mentors, and I can freely say that he is the best mentor. </p>
<p> You can talk to him about any topic while relaxing, </p>
<p> even if it is not related to the lesson, anime, exercise, etc.</p>

<p> The next mentor is Davit Janezashvili, I can't talk much about him because I had very few contact with him,
     but I can freely say that he is very funny and he is also a very good mentor.</p>

<p> And the last mentor is Gabriel Molodin. I can't say much about Gabriel either,
but I know for sure that he is also a very good mentor and any member of the academy will agree with me. </p>

<p> Now let's talk about the leaders of the squad. </p>
<p> It is the duty of the squad leader to supervise the members of his squad to help them with anything they do not understand. </p>
<p> Accordingly, squad leaders are also well paid, </p>
<p> some squad leaders achieved this rank quickly and others took a long time, </p>
<p> I will show you some squad leaders that I know and have heard about. </p>
