    <P> And now we introduce you to some of our mentors
     who try their best to teach us all about programming and grow us into future mentors. </P>


    <p> My mentor is Luka Tshvaradze, unlike other mentors, with whom I have only had contact two or three times,</p>
    <p> I know more about him than other mentors, and I can freely say that he is the best mentor. </p>
    <p> You can talk to him about any topic while relaxing, </p>
    <p> even if it is not related to the lesson, anime, exercise, etc.</p>

    <p> The next mentor is Davit Janezashvili, I can't talk much about him because I had very few contact with him,
         but I can freely say that he is very funny and he is also a very good mentor.</p>

    <p> And the last mentor is Gabriel Molodin. I can't say much about Gabriel either,
    but I know for sure that he is also a very good mentor and any member of the academy will agree with me. </p>

    <p> Now let's talk about the leaders of the squad. </p>
    <p> It is the duty of the squad leader to supervise the members of his squad to help them with anything they do not understand. </p>
    <p> Accordingly, squad leaders are also well paid, </p>
    <p> some squad leaders achieved this rank quickly and others took a long time, </p>
    <p> I will show you some squad leaders that I know and have heard about. </p>
